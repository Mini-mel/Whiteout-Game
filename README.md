## About Whiteout
I created this game in 2015 as part of a programming languages class assignment. With free reign to create basically 'whatever', using a language not covered in class, I chose to use Lua in combination with the LOVE engine to make a game.

The folder "Whiteout" contains the code, while **the Whiteout-executable contains the .exe (and .dlls for the engine) that lets you play it.**

## How to Play
The object of the game is to get a high score by clicking shapes. As time passes, the background lightens in color until it's white, matching the shapes and making it harder to find them.

### Accuracy Challenge
You get two miss-clicks (clicking on the background instead of a shape). After that, your game is over and your score is displayed.

### Timed Challenge
You have 30 seconds to try and rack up the highest score that you can! Unlike accuracy mode, you can click with reckless abandon - the game is only over when the timer reaches zero.
